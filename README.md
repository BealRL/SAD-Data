# SAD-Data
Contains two cleaned versions of a previously developed study regarding social anxiety disorder (SAD). “Data for: Development and use of a clinical decision support system for the diagnosis of social anxiety disorder” contains thirty columns and two hundred and fourteen rows. The first five columns include demographic information such as age, education level, gender, occupation, and whether participants in the study have a family history of social anxiety disorder (SAD) or depression. The next eight columns rate levels of fear of various scenarios based on a ten-point Likert scale. Thirteen columns contain binary responses to personal experiences of physical aspects of SAD. The final three columns contain participants’ prior diagnoses and two alternative SAD test results. 

Iran University of Medical Sciences financially assisted the data and Iran National Committee for Ethics in Biomedical Research approved it. The data report is notably written for medical students and personnel (Fathi, et. al., 2020). The researchers used the data in a multi-step test to discover new ways of determining whether patients have SAD and its severity so that patients can receive swift treatment.
